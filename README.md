## Inspiration behind this

How many of us have longed to reach out to others, while being either stuck at home and/or distant? How many of us canâ€™t find people to play random games with amidst this pandemic? The Vibee app brings the idea of creating rooms for interaction between people after which they can decide to play some games together to stay connected. The intent of this website is to foster community which can offer widespread interaction and forge new friendships. This app also keeps in sight the statistics of the all the games played and offers many more.
